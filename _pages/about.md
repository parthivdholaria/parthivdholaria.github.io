# About Me
Hello Everyone !
I am a B-TECH 3rd year CSE student here at IIIT-Delhi. I hold a strong command in CS funadmentals like Operating systems, Advance Programming , Computer Networks , Analysis and Design of Algorithms , DBMS , Data structures and Algorithms etc.
I am an enthusiast when it comes to Machine Learning and Developement. I started of my college journey by studying Web Developement and am currently looking to explore ML and the various applications it brings to the table. I also developed a taste in Security and would love to explore it somewhere in the future.
In my free time , I mostly hang out with my friends and family. When it comes to sports , I consider myself a decent bowler. A die-hard cricket fan and will always support India no matter what. Also if anyone is interested in playing FIFA, I would always love to play a match with you .

Cheers !

# My achievements

1. My biggest ever achievement was that, I was the highest scorer in 12th CBSE boards exams(94.2%) in my school and was 4rth in 10th CBSE exams.This lay the foundataion of never ending hardwork. This was like a foundation stone from where I never stopped working hard and took my academics very seriously. 

2. In my college, We had many assignments but the Kaggle Challenges in our machine learning course were the most challenging. It was class about 170 students inlcuding B.TECH , M.TECH and PHDs. We were given a dataset[Google Speech Command Dataset] in which we had to predict the words said in the audio clips accuratly. I ranked 11th in the entire batch with an accuracy of 89.78% on unseen testing data. You can see the leaderboard yourself [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gaussian-mixture-models/leaderboard). My id is Parthiv A Dholaria. We were told to only use Gaussian Mixture model for classification and No deep learning models/techniques which made it very challenging.

3. In another kaggle challenge on Human Activity Recognition from UCL. I ranked 17th in the entire batch with an accuracy of 59.798%. I had used KNN to get this accuracy. You can see the leaderbaord rankings [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/unsupervised-learning-m2023/leaderboard). My ID is Parthiv A Dholaria.

4. I am also privileged to be a part of two excellent clubs of my college. Firstly, GDSC i.e Google Developers student club. I developed interests in Web Developement in the first and second years of my B.Tech and I was able to crack the interview by show casing some of my projects in WebD. Secondly, Salt N' Pepper which is a food club of our college. The thing I like about this club is the ability to be creative from a very simple thing like food and make our audience feel happy and entertain them. I learned a lot from the events we conducted at Salt N' Pepper.


# My Projects 

1. Optical Character Recognition(OCR):
As a part of our machine learning course, in a group of 5 we were given a task to correctly classify the optical charcter dataset. The optical character consists of digits from 0-9 and alphabets A-Z.
          A. We performed various pre-processing techniques and Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to understand our data better
          B. After this It was time to extract important features and start training our model and also analyse the performance by using k-fold analysis and other techniques to evaluate the performance of our model.
          C. We managed to get the 99.4 % accuracy for OCR. The model used was a multi-stacked model comprising of KNN, SVM, RandomForest.
          D. Here is the [link](https://github.com/parthivdholaria/ML_Project_OCR) for the entire code and report of our project.

2. Online Retail Store
A deployed Django Web Application. It was a self-learning project when I was trying to study how front-end communicates with the backend and the information is propogated back and forth.
Here is the brief description:
          A. A Django Web application deployed with the help of AWS.
          B. Made use of HTML, CSS, Javascript on front end.
          C. Allows user to create account, user-verification, password reset, shipping facilities.
          D.Paypal API for payment , cart functionality , track orders, shipping functionality.
          E. Here is the [link](https://github.com/parthivdholaria/OnlineRetailStore) for the entire code.



<!-- # A data-driven personal website

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

# Getting started

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

## Site-wide configuration

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [\_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [\_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

## Create content & metadata

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like \_publications, \_talks, \_posts, \_teaching, or \_pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [\_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the \_talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

## How to edit your site's GitHub repository

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
