This lay the foundation of never ending hardwork. This was like a foundation stone from where I never stopped working hard and took my academics very seriously.</p>

                <p class="achievement-text">In my college, We had many assignments but the Kaggle Challenges in our machine learning course were the most challenging. It was class about 170 students including B.TECH, M.TECH and PHDs. We were given a dataset[Google Speech Command Dataset] in which we had to predict the words said in the audio clips accurately. I ranked 11th in the entire batch with an accuracy of 89.78% on unseen testing data. You can see the leaderboard yourself <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gaussian-mixture-models/leaderboard">here</a>. My id is Parthiv A Dholaria. We were told to only use Gaussian Mixture model for classification and No deep learning models/techniques which made it very challenging.</p>

                <p class="achievement-text">I am also privileged to be a part of two excellent clubs of my college. Firstly, GDSC i.e Google Developers student club. I developed interests in Web Development in the first and second years of my B.Tech and I was able to crack the interview by showcasing some of my projects in WebD. Secondly, Salt N' Pepper which is a food club of our college. The thing I like about this club is the ability to be creative from a very simple thing like food and make our audience feel happy and entertain them. I learned a lot from the events we conducted at Salt N' Pepper.</p>
