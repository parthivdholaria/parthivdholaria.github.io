This is my experience as a Teaching assistance in the course Operating systems under the guidance of Prof. Vivek Kumar here at IIIT-Delhi. The criteria for being selected was to have a A grade in OS and A grade in Advance programming. Thanks to Prof. Vivek Kumar for providing me with the opportunity of teaching students and helping out the students with any issues that may have arised during assignments or for any other matter in the course.  
I took the refresher module where I had to teach the fellow students about the pre-requisites of the course. It mainly comprised of teaching C to students.  
I also evaluated assignments according to the rubric and provided students feedbacks on how to improve.  
I also evaluated the midsems and endsem exams.  
Overall It was a great experience. It was the first time I was in such a role where I was the mentor and guide of many students. I learned a lot and am defintly looking to improve. I tried my best answering queries of all students and would want to be in such a role again.
